For Baldur's Gate: EE and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


## Description:
------------

This simple little mod simply adds an appearance from the wingless wonder, Aerie, at the Nashkel Fair in BG1. She's not a joinable NPC (although you can of course do the console thing to add her to your group if you want, but there are no banters written for her). There are a couple of little things you can help her with, and in return she opens a little store at the fair.
