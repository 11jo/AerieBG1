Aerie in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition

Version 1.1

This simple mod simply adds a little appearance from Aerie, (a potential friend and possibly more, who isn't normally introduced until BG2), into BG1.

If you already know her from BG2, then you already know where you're most likely to find her.  If not... well, it's the Nashkel fair.  There are a couple of small things you can help her with, and then she'll offer temple services from out of one of the tents.

To install:

Simply unrar to your game directory (For me its C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00766\), and then double click the file  setup-BG1Aerie.exe , and follow the instructions.

To uninstall, just double click setup-BG1Aerie.exe again.
